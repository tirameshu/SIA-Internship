== Accomplishments ==
- based on GNS3 tutorials and Cisco Basic Router Configuration Guide, added some `ios_config` commands to playbook.
- learnt about EVE Topology Lab usage.
- learnt about switches and VLANs.
    - Layer 2 switches:
        - packets are sent to a specific switch port based on destination *MAC addresses*
        - can assign VLANs to specific switch ports, which could be in different layer 3 subnets
            - each subnet reachable by IP addresses
            - so different layer 3 networks can share the same layer 2 infrastructure
        - uses MAC address
        - cannot be routed
    - Layer 3 switches:
        - a switch that can perform routing
        - requires a default gateway to connect to remote subnets
